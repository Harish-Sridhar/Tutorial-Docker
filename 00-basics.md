# Tutorial-Docker
This tutorial is aimed for absolute beginners of docker who wish to get started with docker as soon as possible without having to read much documentation.

# What is Docker?
Docker is a tool that enables you to build, run your application as an executable package along with all its dependencies:
- code (Your application)
- base os (For ex: Ubuntu/ Centos etc.)
- Installers (For ex: python or java)
- runtime libraries (For ex: packages that you install using pip for python applications / dependent jar files for java applications)
- environment variables
- configuration files.

# Why Docker?
- **Consistent development environment** - Your application where ever (dev/ test/ acceptance/ prod) you deploy or who ever develops, it has same os, installers, dependencies and setup.
- **Ease of application development** - No need to install every executables separately. Just use the docker image of the executable as base image of your application.
- **Ease of application deployment** Just run your application using docker.
- **Versioning** Can easily version not just your application code, but also all its dependencies.
- **Protability** The applications that you build using docker can be run in any platform (Google cloud, aws or in house platforms) that has docker software installed.
- **Isolation** Your application is isolated from other applications running on the same platform.

# Basics
**Image** \- An image is an executable package that includes everything needed to run an application.  
**Container** \- A container is a runtime instance of an image.  
**Dockerfile** \- The file that has all the instructions on how to build an image.
